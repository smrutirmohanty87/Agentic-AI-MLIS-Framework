# MLIS Portal - Residential Quick Quote Test Plan

## Application Overview

The Residential Quick Quote flow on the MLIS Portal (My Legal Indemnity Shop) allows house buyers/sellers to obtain legal indemnity insurance quick quotes without logging in. The flow is a 3-step wizard: Step 1 collects user details and property postcode, Step 2 allows product selection (up to 4 from ~54 products), and Step 3 displays comparison quotes from multiple insurers. The flow supports three jurisdictions: England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. After clicking 'Email quotes to my conveyancer and myself' on Step 3, a confirmation dialog appears with the heading 'Your quick quote has been emailed to you and your conveyancer.', next steps instructions, and a 'Close this window' button. Clicking 'Close this window' dismisses the dialog and the user remains on Step 3.
