# MLIS Policy Cancellation - End-to-End Test Plan

## Application Overview

This test plan covers the complete Policy Cancellation workflow for the MLIS (Mortgage Lender Insurance Services) platform. The cancellation process is initiated exclusively from the Salesforce Lightning Portal (MLIS Underwriting app) using a Vlocity/OmniScript wizard with a 2-step process: Step 1 (Cancel Policy) and Step 2 (Enter Premiums). Post-cancellation verification spans both Salesforce Portal and Broker Portal. Navigation path: Global Search → Submission → Related tab → Insurance Policy → Show more actions → Cancel Policy. Two cancellation categories are supported: 'Cancel from Inception' (auto-fills date, Inside Cooling-Off Period) and 'Cancel Midterm' (editable date picker, Outside Cooling-Off Period). Premium return options: full (auto-populates negative GWP) or partial (manual entry). Tax: Insurance Premium Tax at 12% on UK premiums. Policy status path: In Force → Under Compliance Review → Cancelled → Lapsed. Broker Portal shows 'Live' status for active policies.
